# Numerical-solution-of-the-diffusion-convective-equation-in-a-narrow-cylindrical-channel
The program is an implementation of theoretical modeling of a macroscopic circulating flow induced in a cloud of ferrofluid by an alternating magnetic field. The program is intended for the numerical solution of a hybrid diffusion-convective partial differential equation in a narrow cylindrical channel. This program can be useful for scientific calculations in the field of hydrodynamics. When the program is run, a layer-by-layer (in time) calculation of the concentration of the ferrofluid and the velocity vector of hydrodynamic flows takes place. The results of calculations performed by this program show that the flow rate of the suspension increases with time. The reason for this increase is the rise in the concentration gradient.
